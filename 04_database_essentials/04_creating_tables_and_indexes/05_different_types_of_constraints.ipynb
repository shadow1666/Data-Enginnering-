However, we can also specify **not null constraints** as well as **check constraints** to the columns while adding columns using `ALTER TABLE`.\n", "* `FOREIGN KEY` constraints are created after the tables are created. It is primarily used to define relationship between 2 tables - example: users is parent table and user_login_details is child table with one to many relationship between them.\n", "* `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE` constraints might be added as part of CREATE table statements or ALTER table statements. Both are commonly used practices.\n", "* Let us compare and contrast `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE` constraints.\n", "  * There can be only one `PRIMARY KEY` in a table where as there can be any number of `UNIQUE` constraints.\n", "  * `UNIQUE` columns can have null values unless `NOT NULL` is also enforced. In case of `PRIMARY KEY`, both uniqueness as well as not null are strictly enforced. In other words a  primary key column cannot be null where as unique column can be null.\n", "  * `FOREIGN KEY` from a child table can be defined against `PRIMARY KEY` column or `UNIQUE` column.\n", "  * Typically `PRIMARY KEY` columns are surrogate keys which are supported by sequence.\n", "  * `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` can be composite.
